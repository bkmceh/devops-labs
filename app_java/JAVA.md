# Best practices that I used in Java App

- Spring-boot framework that now is a standard of Web App on Java
- Divide logic into different packages (like controller, view and etc.)
- Use Lombok that also a good practices in Java code.
It is simplified classes and automate some things like making
constructs, getters etc.
- Use application.properties file for some configs (like server port).
- Use maven for building and running the project.
